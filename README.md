In the realm of code's command domain,
Where datasets flow like a constant rain,
TSO and ISPF mark the way,
Guiding hands through tasks each day. ☀️

JCL, the language of job's design,
Defines the steps, a routine's spine,
While utilities like IDCAMS wield,
Dataset mastery, a crucial field. 🏛️

USS, akin to Unix's grace,
Navigates files in a familiar space.
Commands in clusters, a professional's art,
Crafting the mainframe's beating heart. 💎
